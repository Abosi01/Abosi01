Findings
High Level

Top % indexes, based on injection rate were analyzed to get an idea of the data being used in CE. Following were the high level findings:

    4 of the top 5 indexes were using Logmon log's
    For the indexes that were using Logmon, ~60% of the logs were INFO or TRANSACTION

Detailed
5.2 TB	usgm_logmon_terrafirma	logmon	~ 76% of logs are INFO logs
1.7 TB	usgm_logmon_cxo	logmon	~ 56% of logs are INFO logs
2.8 TB	usgm_logmon_custprofile	logmon	~ 65% of logs are INFO logs

 
Suggestions
1	

    Remove INFO log's using HF.
    Remove unused fields from Logmon logs

	

    Potential of 50% capacity to be freed (if adopted for all index)

	

    Difficult to get customer buy-in as they may be using INFO logs for debugging
    Additional N/W hop because of Universal Forwarded

2	

    Remove INFO log's using FluentD/FluentBit
    Remove unused fields from Logmon logs

	

    Potential of 50% capacity to be freed (if adopted for all index)
    N/W utilization will decrease

	

    Difficult to get customer buy-in as they may be using INFO logs for debugging
    Stability of FluentD/FluentBit is an issue

3	

    Move INFO log's to a separate index with lesser retention (3/5 days).
    Remove unused fields from Logmon logs

	

    Potential of 35% capacity to be freed (if adopted for all index)
    Better chance to get customer buy-in

	

    Additional N/W hop because of Universal Forwarded

4	

    Ask CE to correct logging (Currently warning errors etc are logged as INFO) & change log level to WARN.
        Move terms typically used in adhoc query to WARN/ERROR
        Most of the current dashboards do not rely on INFO logs
        (TODO : verify for all logs)

	

    No additional capacity or N/W Bandwidth needed for HF
    Reduction in disk space needed
